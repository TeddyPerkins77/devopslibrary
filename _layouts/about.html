                      The DevOps Library is a free, online learning resource for
                      aspiring DevOps Engineers, System Admins, Developers, Site
                      Reliability Engineers, Automation Engineers, and anyone else
                      who has an interest in DevOps.  We strive to create not only
                      the highest quality videos, but to always remain a free resource
                      for the DevOps community.

                      My name is <a href="mailto:samantha@devopslibrary.com">Samantha Ventura</a>, and I am the Director of Learning Initiatives for the DevopsLibrary.
                      I am a native Californian, and have been in the field of education for the
                      past 15 years. I received my BA degree in English from San Diego State
                      University, then later my Masters in Teaching, with a specialization in
                      Reading. I am currently finishing up my PhD in Organizational Leadership
                      and plan to continue to work as an executive trainer and learning coach,
                      specializing in the area of higher education and diversity awareness.
                      In my spare time I love everything outdoors, including skiing, fishing,
                      camping and spending time with my family.

                      Behind the scenes, <a href="mailto:ken@devopslibrary.com">Ken Erwin</a> contributes all the content for
                      the course.  He has experience leading a variety of DevOps teams and initiatives
                      at several companies, including Angieâ€™s List and Interactive Intelligence before
                      finally founding the DevOps Library.  Ken is best known in DevOps circles for
                      setting up the largest Windows Chef deployment in the world at the time, with
                      over 4,000 nodes in over 13 locations.
